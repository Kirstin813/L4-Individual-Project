## Data

Data from evaluations are stored here. 

In the `data/raw` file, it contains log files from the output of the x and y coordinates of the pixels detected when matching a colour. Each log file represents a different colour and is named accordingly. To capture this data, code was modified in the src to log the coordinates to the console when holding up a coloured object in the video stream. These modiications have been commented out of the final implementation but can be uncommented to produce similar results. 

In the `data/processed` file, it contains the excel spreasheets used to produce the graphs from the gathered data.
