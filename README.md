# L4project

This is my L4 project for the 2021-22 academic year.

### Project Description 

The aim and ultimate goal of this project is to implement a fully self driving car robot using webBluetooth via the browser on a smartphone. The small car robot I will be using for this project, provided by my supervisor is pictured below. The idea is that by placing your own smartphone onto the attachment on the robot and using a link to a webpage it will be able to connect to the robot (webBluetooth) which will allow the robot to perform basic actions such as forward, backward, left, and right. 

The inspiration behind this project stems from a product created by Amazon called 'Amazon Deep Racer competition'. This competition allows consumers to learn about machine learning, implement their own self driving car robot and partake in a competition to analyse whose robot is the best. However, this self driving robot costs a considerable amount of money and would probably include some software packages or other libraries to be downloaded for it to work. The self driving car robot that I plan to implement would not require for any software to be downloaded as the code and all of its functions is ran from the web browser and the cost would be much cheaper. 

This project is divided into 4 stages:

1. Follow a coloured object 
2. Follow a face 
3. Follow a black line 
4. Fully self driving 

Breaking it up into these stages will allow steady progress and the opportunity to learn from each stage before moving onto the next.
