# Meeting Notes - 04/03/22

## Week 22 

### Progress 

- Worked on the repository documentation by adding instructions for use and demos 
- Spent time writing some of the dissertation - focussing on the introduction
- Created a general plan for a few different evaluations that I could do 
- Continue with the implementation of the final stage 

### Issues 

- One of the implementations from a previous stage was not accessing the camera properly and was not collecting the required pixel data 
- Switching the camera using MediaPipe is still presenting some challenges - if not working by next week, will need to move on 

### Discussion 

- Discussed that it would be good to map out how I want my evaluations to look like so that I know what kind of data to collect and how to plot it
- Agreed that if the final stage of implementation is not working, then it would be sensible to move on and complete the dissertation/evaluation with the other implementation stages 


### Next Weeks Goals 

- Continue with final stage implementation 
- Create a detailed plan for the evaluation 
- Continue with the dissertation 
- Start collecting the data for evaluation 

### Other Meeting Notes
