# Meeting Notes - 03/12/21

## Week 10 Meeting 

### Progress 

- Finished implementation for face tracking using ml5.js 
- Recorded demos 


### Discussion 

- Using ml5.js seems to be quite laggy when used on a mobile device - decided it might be better using MediaPipe as it is more compatible with mobile processing power 
- Discussed a solution to solve a delay in robot movement and why the delay was happening 


### Next Weeks Goals

- Create a plan for project week 
- Update the repository - readme, missed timelog entries, etc 
- Working on face tracking implementation using MediaPipe 

### Other Meeting Notes

- N/A
