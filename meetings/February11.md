# Meeting Notes - 11/02/22

## Week 18 Meeting 

### Progress

- Averaged the pixel array 
- Created a new circuit using black paint 
- Recorded some demos 
- Researched how to make the robot move more like a car 
- Began research for the last stage 

### Discussion 

- Decided to revert back to using black tape as the paint was not as good as originally intended 
- There is a way to make the robot move more like a car but with time constraints it may not be possible to be completed by the end of this project - good discussion point for the disseration 

### Next Weeks Goals 

- Re-record some demos 
- Continue with dissertation writing 
- Look into finding some pre-trained models to use from the last stage 

### Other Meeting 

- Points to discuss in dissertation - Web Bluetooth not working with iOS, current devices on the market, etc 
- For the last stage, we can work towards making it avoid objects and reach an end point (like a finish line)
