A week-by-week plan for the project. 
Updated at the start of each week. Will outline plan for the week and what is expected to be achieved by the end of the week. 

## Winter semester

* **Week 0**
    * Bidding week for project allocation - Ranked projects into top 8 choices
* **Week 1**
    * Project allocation to be expected at the beginning of the week
    * Initial meeting with the project supervisor to discuss project requirements and outline a plan 
    * Begin research into topics relevant to the project
* **Week 2**
    * Pick up self-driving robot
    * Continue research into the project 
    * Set up basic repository until a repository template is released 
    * Create a presentation outlining the scope of the project and the current approach/plan 
    * Presentation scope of the project to my supervisor's supervisees 
* **Week 3**
    * Conduct further research into specific topics i.e. WebBluettoth, P5js, Espruino, and camera libraries 
    * Create my own basic JS webpage to connect to the robot and move it about 
    * Research into camera APIs
    * Have my weekly meeting with my supervisor 
* **Week 4**
    * Write up all relevant research into LaTeX
    * Implement a webpage to access the camera via the web browser 
    * Discuss progress and issues during the weekly supervisor meeting 
* **Week 5**
    * Finish implementing the webpage that will access the camera and follow a red object 
    * Create a demo of this in action to present to my supervisor during our weekly meeting 
    * Devise a plan for the next stage of the project - follow a face using the camera via web browser 
    * Start research into APIs or relevant information that would be beneficial in the next stage
* **Week 6**
    * Add improvements suggested by supervisor 
    * Record a demo featuring the new improvements to present to supervisor 
    * Continue additional research into face api's
    * Start working on the next stage by allowing the camera to detect a face
* **Week 7**
    * Finish off any tasks that had not been completed from the previous week 
    * Make the camera detect a face 
    * Using the same technique from stage 1, follow the face and move the robot with respect to the position of the face on the canvas 
    * Report findings and update progress to supervisor
* **Week 8**
    * New issue developed over the weekend, connection using web Bluetooth stopped working on p5.js so it is a priority to solve this issue
    * Continue with the implementation of the faceAPI, allowing the robot to move according to the position of the face 
    * Start research on the next stage of the project (follow a black line)
    * Present all demos and findings to supervisor during the weekly meeting 
* **Week 9**
    * Transferring implementations to GitHub pages which will now be the main hosting platform 
    * Continue with faceAPI implementation 
    * Meeting with supervisor 
    * Start implementation on nose tracking for faceAPI
* **Week 10**
    * Continue and finish implementation of switching between cameras 
    * Continue with faceAPI implementation using the nose as the main tracking feature 
    * Meeting with supervisor 
    * Update GitHub
* **Week 11** 
    * Update all changes to the repository - timelog, plan, readme 
    * finish both faceAPI implementation using the nose tracking feature 
    * Record a demo for supervisor to review 
    * Devise a detailed plan for the project week
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]**
    * Update supervisor on status of project during weekly meeting 
    * Make a switch to a different face API to better handle mobile camera better 
    * Add all features from the previous implementation 
    * Conducted general tests to ensure it all works correctly 
* **Week 13 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
    * Code tidy up 
    * Update readme.md files for more information and background on the project 
    * Record demos 
    * Continue working on the switching camera issue
    * Update supervisor and write up status report
