    * Begin research into topics relevant to the project
* **Week 3**
    * Pick up self-driving robot
    * Continue research into the project 
    * Set up basic repository until a repository template is released 
    * Create a presentation outlining the scope of the project and the current approach/plan

    * Implement a webpage to access the camera via the web browser 
    * Discuss progress and issues during the weekly supervisor meeting 
* **Week 6**
    * Finish implementing the webpage that will access the camera and follow a red object 
    * Create a demo of this in action to present to my supervisor during our weekly meeting

    * Start research into APIs or relevant information that would be beneficial in the next stage
* **Week 7**
    * Add improvements suggested by supervisor 
    * Record a demo featuring the new improvements to present to supervisor 
    * Continue additional research into face api's
    * Start working on the next stage by allowing the camera to detect a face
* **Week 8**
    * Finish off any tasks that had not been completed from the previous week 
    * Make the camera detect a face 
    * Using the same technique from stage 1, follow the face and move the robot with respect to the position of the face on the canvas 
    * Report findings and update progress to supervisor
* **Week 9**
    * New issue developed over the weekend, connection using web Bluetooth stopped working on p5.js so it is a priority to solve this issue
    * Continue with the implementation of the faceAPI, allowing the robot to move according to the position of the face 
    * Start research on the next stage of the project (follow a black line)
    * Present all demos and findings to supervisor during the weekly meeting
